# Simple Blog System

This is a Simple Blog System written in PHP. It currently includes logging in+out and creating a blog. It's currently very basic in terms of features but I intend on adding more features as I need them.

On purpose, one file, `database.php`, has been ignored as it contains
sensitive information for database connections.

Usage steps coming soon.
